# enkiMI

## enki Minecraft Importer

A permissively licensed lightweight C and C++ Minecraft Importer library.

## Building

A cmake file is included for the example code, but to use in your project simply add the 2 .c the files in [/src](https://github.com/dougbinks/enkiMI/tree/master/src) into your project and add the director to your include paths.

## Using

enkiMI currently includes NBT file reading (compressed or uncompressed), and region/anvil file chunk extraction.

```
FILE *fp = fopen( "../example/r.1.0.mca", "rb" );
enkiRegionFile regionFile = enkiRegionFileLoad( fp );
for( int i = 0; i < ENKI_MI_REGION_CHUNKS_NUMBER; i++ )
{
    enkiNBTDataStream stream;
    enkiInitNBTDataStreamForChunk( regionFile,  i, &stream );
    if( stream.dataLength )
    {
        enkiChunkBlockData aChunk = enkiNBTReadChunk( &stream );
        enkiMICoordinate chunkOriginPos = enkiGetChunkOrigin( &aChunk ); // y always 0
        printf( "Chunk at xyz{ %d, %d, %d }  Number of sections: %d \n",
            chunkOriginPos.x, chunkOriginPos.y, chunkOriginPos.z, aChunk.countOfSections );
    }
    enkiNBTFreeAllocations( &stream );
}
enkiRegionFileFreeAllocations( &regionFile );
fclose( fp );
```
